STLs with "hires" in the name are containing fine details, the 0.25mm or smaller nozzle and 0.1mm or smaller layer height is recommended.

3. Screw the drill jig to the board, drill 3/16" holes for the banana plugs.

4. Mark the outer border of the board, cut the excess material. A drill jig can be used to make the clean edge.

5. Insert banana plugs as shown. Check the height protruding from the other side, should be 1mm*. A leveling jig can be used.
